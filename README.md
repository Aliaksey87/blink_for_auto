In this video, I am assembling a prototype of a turn signal for auto or motorcycle equipment (or anywhere). The device is based on arduino nano. Knows how to memorize the selected mode and, after the power is restored, continue to work on it. When the turn signal lever is pressed briefly, the signal is triggered 3 times. In the memory of the arduinka, eleven signal work programs are stored. With two keys it is possible to select one of these programs.
